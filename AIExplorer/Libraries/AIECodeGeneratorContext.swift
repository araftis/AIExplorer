 Provides a code generator context for tracking information about the code generation.
 
 This also provides a number of useful utilities for generating code. Generally speaking, you'll subclass this in your library and use it when doing your code generation.
 
 Generally speaking, you use the context by initializing one with the provided output stream, and then you make calls through it, rather than to the output stream itself. The context will then deal with things like progressing to through the neural network graph, allowing you to write out the generated code without having to working about things like indented or specific formatting issues nearly as much.
