/**
 Provides a code generator context for tracking information about the code generation.
 
 This also provides a number of useful utilities for generating code. Generally speaking, you'll subclass this in your library and use it when doing your code generation.
 
 Generally speaking, you use the context by initializing one with the provided output stream, and then you make calls through it, rather than to the output stream itself. The context will then deal with things like progressing to through the neural network graph, allowing you to write out the generated code without having to working about things like indented or specific formatting issues nearly as much.

     Writes a function, as defined by `type`, which generally means a function prototype, implementation, or call. This method is useful when generating your code, as it will do a lot of repetitive work for you, and the while keeping things formatted correctly.
     
     You can generate code for three kinds of function, as defined by `type`:
     
     1. **prototype** The function prototype. Not all languages need this, like Swift or Python, but some do, like C++ and Obj-C. This should not include `body`. Other valid parameters are `documentation`, `documentationPosition`, `argumentsIndented`, `arguments`, and `returnType`.
     2. **implementation** The implementation of the function. When doing this, you should generally include a `body` as well. All parameters are value, although you don't necessarily need to provide documentation for the implementation, depending on language.
     3. **call** Use this when you're calling a function. This should not include `body`. On the `name`, `type`, and `arguments` parameters are valid.
     
     When you call this, a new `FunctionContext` is created and pushed on a stack. This allows you to call this method a second time from within the `body` code provided.
     
     - parameter name The name of the function. You can also think of this as the function's "prefix", so while "my_function" would be fine, so woudl "my_object.my_function".
     - parameter type The type of function call being made.
     - parameter documentation The documentation for the function. May not be necessary.
     - parameter documentationPosition The position of the documentation. This is generally defined by default via the `defaultDocumentationPosition` property, so you'll rarely, if ever, need to provide this.
     - parameter argumentsIndented If `true`, each argument will be on a new line and indented. This can be useful for functions with a lot of parameters.
     - parameter arguments A block of code providing the arguments. The block should really only include calls to `writeArgument()` from within this block, although you could, in theory, also call back into `writeFunction()` to start an embedded function call.
     - parameter returnType The return type of the function. This may not be necessary, depending on the language.
     - parameter body A code block that writes the body of the function. This may certainly call back into `writeFunction()` to make additional function calls. You don't need to provide this parameter for `prototype` or `call` types. This is really just a short hand for calling `indent()` after writing the initial function declaration.
