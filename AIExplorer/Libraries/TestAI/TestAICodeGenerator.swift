        This function builds the model. The model built is based on the model designed with AI Explorer. If `is_training` is `False`, then the model is built ready for inference, otherwise it's built for training. As part of being built for training, the model will be compiled using the supplied loss and optimization options chosen in the modeler.

        Parameters
        ----------
        isTraining : boolean
            Determines whether the model is built for training or not.

        Returns
        -------
        A TensorFlow model ready for training or inference.
