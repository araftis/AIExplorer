     Returns an array of related objects from this graphic.

     This is necessary, because our graphics obejct's aren't really a graph, they're graphics. However, because we've conencted two graphics together via links, we can actually treat them like a graph. That being said, it's a little bit of a pain to traverse the graph, so this method returns the related objects.

     These aren't strictly "children", so I'm going with the "destinationObjects" moniker. These are objects that "point to" other objects. On the flip side, "sourceObjects" represent objects that point to us.

     Finally, if you're going to traverse the graph, you'll need to make sure you don't enter into retain cycles, as the graphs can very much produce cycles.
